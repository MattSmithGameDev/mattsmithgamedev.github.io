        <span class="text-area">
            <p>
                I'm Matt, recent graduate with First Class Honours in Computing (Games Programming) at Edge Hill
                University. Games development has been a passion of mine since roughly 2008, mainly thanks to the
                Nintendo Wii.
                After a few years of dabbling with small text-based adventure games written in batch files from YouTube
                tutorials, I switched my focus to games with actual graphics. Between 2014 and 2016, I would make tiny,
                terrible games
                in the Unity game engine and RPG Maker. None were any good, nor were any finished, but each one taught
                me something new and forced me to face and solve new challenges.

            <p>
                I finally committed to an online course for Unity in 2017 which refined my foundation of YouTube
                tutorials and online guides into something of a somewhat higher quality. During this time, I completed
                high school and my GCSEs, giving me some more flexibilty in how much I could focus on my hobby and a bit
                more urgency for working out exactly what I was going to do after education. I took the
                Computing BTEC offered at West Lancashire college. My favourite modules were those focused on
                programming
                related skills - until now, all of my programming had been self-motivated and I had never programmed
                with an end goal or
                requirements in mind. Deadlines and requirements introduce a new challenge, but it was one I took head
                on,eventually graduating with a D*D*D*.

            <p>
                My final term in college aligned with the start of COVID. In a time where everything was uncertain, I
                continued to work on these skills and prepare for university. Finally being in education with a focus
                on programming, specifically games, was exhilirating and allowed me to further build those skills I'd
                been cultivating for a decade. With new friends who shared these interests, I took on the three years
                with head held high despite the circumstances of first year and the stressful nights all throughout.
                Despite it all, I graduated July 2023 with a First Class Honours degree in Computing (Games Programming)
                and am more excited than ever to see what the world has for me next.

                This page serves as an online portfolio of my work, collected from both university projects and personal
                projects. You'll have to excuse the simplistic design - I'm a programmer at heart, not a designer!
