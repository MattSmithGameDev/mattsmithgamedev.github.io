        <span class="text-area">
            <p>
                I'm Matt, recent graduate with First Class Honours in Computing (Games Programming) at Edge Hill
                University. Games development has been a passion of mine since roughly 2008, mainly thanks to the
                Nintendo Wii, though I have had a long time interest in video games as a whole.
                After a few years of dabbling with small text-based adventure games written in batch files from YouTube
                tutorials, I switched my focus to games with actual graphics. Between 2014 and 2016, I would make tiny,
                terrible games
                in the Unity game engine and RPG Maker. None were any good, nor were any finished, but each one taught
                me something new and forced me to face and solve new challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                I finally committed to an online course for Unity in 2017 which refined my foundation of YouTube
                tutorials and online guides into something of a somewhat higher quality. During this time, I completed
                high school and my GCSEs, giving me some more flexibilty in how much I could focus on my hobby and a bit
                more urgency for working out exactly what I was going to do after education. I took the
                Computing BTEC offered at West Lancashire college. My favourite modules were those focused on
                programming
                related skills - until now, all of my programming had been self-motivated and I had never programmed
                with an end goal or
                requirements in mind. Deadlines and requirements introduce a new challenge, but it was one I took head
                on, eventually graduating with a D*D*D*.
            </p>
            <p>
                My final term in college aligned with the start of COVID. In a time where everything was uncertain, I
                continued to work on these skills and prepare for university. Finally being in education with a focus
                on programming, specifically games, was exhilirating and allowed me to further build those skills I'd
                been cultivating for a decade. With new friends who shared these interests, I took on the three years
                with head held high despite the circumstances of first year and the stressful nights all throughout.
                Despite it all, I graduated July 2023 with a First Class Honours degree in Computing (Games Programming)
                and am more excited than ever to see what the world has for me next.

            This page serves as an online portfolio of my work, collected from both university projects and personal

                <h2>VR Escape Room - Laser Puzzle</h2>
                <img src="images/lumis-laser.png">
                <p class="text-area">As part of a second year module on using games engines, a virtual reality puzzle
                    game was created among a team of developers. I was one in a team of four working on this project and
                    was involved in the wider thematic planning of the game and responsible for the planning,
                    implementation, and creation of my own puzzle room within the game. This process expanded my ability
                    to work with others and make use of assets not made by myself (A welcome change as I am no artist).
                </p>
                <p class="text-area">My section of the game was built around a reflecting laser puzzle where the player
                    must translate reflecting dishes along a defined axis to influence the laser's path. Inspiration was
                    drawn from laser puzzles featured in <i>Half Life</i> and <i>My Sims Agents</i> The puzzle is
                    intentionally simple and understandable as it was designed with first-time VR users in mind. This
                    approach also encourage level design which silent introduced the player to what must be done - for
                    example, the movement nodes are a noticeable green, and the laser origin and end point are bright
                    and obvious.

                <img src="images/gravity-platformer.png">
                <p class="text-area"><i>Gravity Platformer</i> refers to a series of prototypes produced as part of my
                    final Research and Development module in university. Two 2D and one 3D prototype were produced
                    inspired by the mecahnics of the gravity interactions of <i>Kerbal Space Program</i>, <i>Super Mario
                        Galaxy</i>, and <i>Angry Birds Space</i>, among others.</p>
                <p class="text-area">While the 3D prototype was never fully realised due to time constraints, the second
                    2D prototype presents a decent implementation of the mechanics, including multiple gravity types and
                    non-player rigidbody interaction.</p>
                <p class="text-area">Sadly, no final and polished product was able to achieved, but the project was an
                    amazing learning experience and one I would love to revist in future.</p>

                <h2>Save the Environment: A Recycling Game</h2>
                <img src="images/recycling.png">
                <p class="text-area"><i>Save the Environment</i> was a team game produced as part of an employability
                    module in university. Within this team, I acted as the primary programmer, writing much of the code
                    for the project, while other members focused on art assets, team co-ordination, and documentation
                    tasks. The game, aimed at younger audiences, was designed as a fun way to encourage correct
                    recylcing habits, where the player must match materials, like glass or plastic, into the correct
                    waste bin.</p>
                <p class="text-area">Due to a short time frame given for the project and other, larger projects
                    requiring more attention, my time management skills were pushed. Despite this, the game was
                    completed on time and to a standard the team was happy with. If given more time, there were many
                    more ideas, such as leaderboards and multiple game modes, that we would have loved to implement, but
                    given the constraints, we deemed them not to be important enough in this case.</p>
